## Description
### What is this?
A simple blog where you can create, read, update, and delete blog posts and their comments.

### How does it work?
The Blog's backend is built on Node.js and Express for routing to serve content to the front-end while handling retrieving, creating, and deleting notes.
HTML templating is done using Handlebars.js to provide an interactive experience.
